            Just adding a prefix like "un-" to the beginning of a word, or a suffix like "-less" to the end of a word, can completely change its meaning. Shakespeare did this with words like the verb "dress," which means "to put on clothes," to create "undress," which means "to take off clothes." He also made the word "count" into an adjective by changing it to "countless," which means "too many to count."

Making new words didn't start or stop with Shakespeare, however. New words are still being made in the same way today — such as "overshare," which means sharing too much information, which was just added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2021
